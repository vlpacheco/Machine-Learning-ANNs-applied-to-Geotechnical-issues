# Machine-Learning-ANNs-applied-to-Geotechnical-issues
This work is related to an application of ANNs to a Geotechnical issue. 
So, the abstract of the research article goes as:
Techniques that reduce the use of common cement such as Portland are the subject of studies in the current state-of-the-art. 
Biocementation, or called Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) is a geotechnical alternative, 
as well as for use in concretes, mortars, and immobilization of inorganic compounds. Based on the existing multi independent variables 
and to determine the responses, methodologies for the optimization of such processes are used based on experimental data. For that, 
the Response Surface Method (RSM) is a useful tool and widely used for this purpose. However, other alternatives have become viable with the development 
of machine learning, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This article studied and compared the optimization of the specific urease activity (SUA) and 
the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation rate previously performed through RSM by different authors and optimized the same variables through ANN. 
The coefficient of determination (R2), average absolute deviation (AAD), and absolute error were analyzed and compared between the two methodologies, 
also generating surface responses for the optimized ANN. With that, two neural networks, ANN 1 (for SUA) and ANN 2 (for CaCO3 precipitation) were developed and 
applied to the data sets of both studies. As a result, ANN 1 and ANN 2 obtained coefficient errors of 0.9575 and 0.9968, respectively 
(compared to coefficient errors via the RSM of 0.9021 and 0.8530, respectively). AAD and absolute error also demonstrated better accuracy. 
Therefore, the optimal conditions of the ANNs were more accurate compared to the experimental data compared to the RSM methodology.
